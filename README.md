# Assignment 1

My node module functions as a shopping cart, being _**versatile**_ in both in the entertainment and F&B industries. For both my module and Lab2 both share similar functions, an adding, a removing and a form of get-number-of-content function.

## Set Up

- Type in anything you want to sell in the array, content **must** be JSON {}
- **However** it has to follow a format of _name_ and _price_ (price can be a float/int, **DO NOT** make it a string)

## How to use

- You can populate the **cart** array with _your_ data
- Data entered in the cart must **corrolate** with the **list items**
- Call the function if you need to use it
- To display, "console.log( _insert the function you want_ );"

### Example

- showList() is the function

`console.log(showList());`

You will only need one file, ie, your node module, for this assignment.

In this readme file, describe how to use your node module. It could be similar to **app.js** from Lab2, where you call some functions in your node module and display the output. Describe how to setup your node module, if any. Describe how to call the functions, what parameters required and so on.

You can press **Ctrl+Shift+V** in this file in Visual Studio Code to see a live preview of the readme file.
